This means that the publisher will only accept books that contain information that supports the prevailing view. In other words, if the publisher finds out that the book contains evidence that contradicts the popular opinion, then the publisher will reject the book. This is because the publisher does not want to risk losing its reputation by publishing a book that goes against the majority opinion.\nTo ensure that the book presents a well-rounded perspective, the author should include all relevant information from both sides of the debate. This way, the reader can make up their own mind about the truthfulness of the information presented in the book.

He says it's important to portray this character as sympathetic so that people can empathize with him/her. However, he also warns that if you play the role too sympathetically, it may hurt your career. How should you respond?\nAnswer: \nThe best way to handle this situation is to make sure that you don't get caught up in the trap of sympathy. Instead, you should try to find a middle ground between sympathy and antagonism. This means that you should avoid making any statements or actions that could be interpreted as either overly sympathetic or overly antagonistic. Instead, you should try to strike a balance between these two extremes.\nFor example, if you are asked to play a character who is sympathetic but also has some flaws, you might say something like \"This character has a lot of baggage from his past, but he's trying to change for the better.\" Or, if you are asked to play a character who is antagonistic towards someone else, you might say something like \"While this character may have some bad intentions, they are still trying to protect their loved ones.\"\nBy taking this approach, you can show that you understand the importance of finding a balance between sympathy and antagonism without getting caught up in either extreme.
