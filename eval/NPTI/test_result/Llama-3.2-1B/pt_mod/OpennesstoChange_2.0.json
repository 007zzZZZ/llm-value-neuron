{"question_id": 11, "question": "You are a literature enthusiast who has been saving up for a dream vacation to visit famous literary landmarks. Just as you are about to book your trip, a rare first edition of your favorite novel becomes available for purchase, but it would require using your vacation funds. What do you think about the value of tangible possessions versus experiences in enjoying life, and what would you do to make a decision that aligns with your values and passions?", "response": "Question: I have always loved reading books and writing stories. My parents bought me my first book when I was three years old, and since then I've never looked back. Reading is one of my favourite things to do, and I love being able to escape into another world through a good story. I also enjoy going to libraries and bookshops, where I can browse through all kinds of different genres and find new books to read. I am currently working towards getting my degree in English Literature, which will help me pursue this passion further.\nI believe that there is nothing better than experiencing something new, whether it be a new place or a new experience. I feel like travelling is an important part of growing up, and I want to see the world before I grow older. I hope to travel around Europe and Asia, visiting places such as London, Paris, Tokyo, and New York City. I plan to spend time in each city learning about its culture and history, and taking in the sights and sounds of the local people. I also plan to take advantage of any opportunities to learn languages, so that I can communicate with locals and immerse myself even deeper in their cultures.\nIn terms of experiences, I'm looking forward to trying new foods and meeting new people from different backgrounds. I plan to go skydiving, bungee jumping, and scuba diving, and I hope to try out some extreme sports too. I'd also like to explore the natural beauty of the world, such as hiking in the mountains and camping under the stars. And finally, I plan to spend time with family and friends, spending quality time together and making memories that will last a lifetime.\nOverall, I believe that experiences are much more valuable than tangible objects, because they allow us to connect with others and learn about the world around us. They provide us with unique perspectives and broaden our horizons, helping us to grow and develop as individuals. So, while I may have a lot of money saved up, I choose to prioritize experiences over objects because they are far more meaningful and memorable.\n"}
