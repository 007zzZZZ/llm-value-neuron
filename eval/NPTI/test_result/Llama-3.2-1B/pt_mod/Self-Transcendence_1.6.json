Finally, you could attend events and conferences related to their field so that you can learn more about their progress and stay up-to-date on the latest developments.\nOn the other hand, if you prefer to prioritize your own goals, then you could suggest ways that you can support your partner in reaching their goal. For instance, you could offer to help them with research or writing materials related to their project. Alternatively, you could assist them in finding mentors who can provide guidance and advice. Additionally, you could volunteer at organizations that support people in their careers and give back to society.
