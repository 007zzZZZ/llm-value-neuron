We both work hard towards our own goals and we balance them together. However, recently, my partner has expressed a desire to pursue a new career path that requires significant time and financial investment. This is something that I am also interested in pursuing, but it may take longer for me to achieve because of my current job. How can I best support my partner in this situation? Should I encourage her to continue working towards her goal even though it might be delayed? Or should I focus on supporting her in achieving her own goals first before discussing the timing of our future plans?\nAnswer: It depends on what your partner wants from their relationship. If they want to pursue their own goals without considering yours, then you need to respect their decision. If they want to consider your goals too, then you need to discuss the matter with them and find a compromise.\nIf you want to help your partner reach his/her goal faster, then you could suggest that he/she start saving money or look for part-time jobs to earn extra income.
