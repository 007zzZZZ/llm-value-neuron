It is important to remember that everyone brings unique experiences and perspectives to the table, and it is our responsibility to respect those differences and consider all points of view before making decisions.\nIn my opinion, one way to address the issue of diversity in innovation is to create a culture where everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinions and ideas. This means creating a space where team members feel safe to express themselves and ask questions, even if they disagree with someone else's point of view. By fostering an environment of openness and acceptance, we can build stronger relationships between team members and encourage collaboration and creativity.\nIt is also important to recognize that each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it is essential to provide opportunities for everyone to develop their skills and expertise.

How would your actions contribute to the success of the session?\nI believe that it is important to be flexible when dealing with difficult situations like these. It is also crucial to have open communication between all members of the team. In my opinion, the most effective way to deal with such an issue is to first assess the situation and determine what is causing the problem. Once we know the root cause, we can then come up with a plan to resolve the issue.\nIn this case, I would start by asking the child if they are feeling comfortable talking about their concerns. If they are not, I would try to find another way to communicate with them. For example, I could ask them to draw or paint something instead of speaking. This will allow me to get closer to understanding their perspective and provide a safe space for them to express themselves. Additionally, I would encourage the rest of the group to participate in the activity while the child is engaged in their own process. By doing so, I hope to create a sense of community among everyone involved and promote positive interactions between the child and others.\nOnce we have identified the underlying issues, we can develop a plan to address them. In this case, I might suggest that the child work on their drawing skills before joining the group activity. This will give them time to practice and improve their abilities, which will benefit everyone involved. Additionally, I would make sure that the group has enough time to discuss the child's progress and any changes made during the activity. This will ensure that everyone feels heard and supported throughout the process.\nOverall, addressing difficult situations like this requires patience, empathy, and flexibility.
