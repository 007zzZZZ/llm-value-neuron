One day, my manager came up to me and said \"I need someone to work on our new project.\" He was very excited about it and told me that he had some ideas about how we could make it better. I agreed to help him out but only if he gave me a chance to review his ideas first. After reviewing them, I found that they were all wrong. My manager was disappointed because he thought that he knew what he wanted done and didn't want anyone else to tell him anything. However, after discussing it with him further, he realized that he did not know everything there was to know about the problem and needed help from others. So, he asked me to join forces with him so that both of us could come up with a solution together. We worked hard on the project until it was finished and submitted it to the client. It turned out to be successful! Now, when people ask me why I'm so happy, I say that I feel like I've made a big contribution to society.\n"}
