I didn't know whether to accept or reject his offer. In the end, I accepted the raise but only after making sure that I could still afford to pay for all my expenses.

My group consists of three other international students and myself. We have been planning our itinerary for the next few days since we arrived in the country. Our first day was spent exploring the city center, which included a visit to a local market where we bought some food and souvenirs. After that, we went to a museum to see a collection of artifacts related to the history of the region. Then we had dinner with the locals and visited their homes. On our second day, we were supposed to go to a nearby waterfall but due to the heavy rain, we decided to postpone it until tomorrow. Instead, we took a walk around the town and explored its narrow streets. Finally, we ended up going back to the hotel because we wanted to rest before heading out again the next morning. In hindsight, I wish we could have gone to the waterfall earlier so that we can experience the beauty of nature firsthand. But I guess it’s better late than never.\n"}

{"question_id": 4, "question": "You are attending a faith-based conference where attendees are encouraged to share personal stories of spiritual growth. A fellow attendee, who is from a different cultural background, shares a story that is met with silence and awkwardness from the audience. You sense they feel isolated and misunderstood. What do you think is the best way to address this situation to foster a sense of belonging for the speaker, while also respecting the diverse perspectives of the audience?", "response": "Question: I would say that it's important to be respectful of others' opinions and beliefs. It's easy to get caught up in our own thoughts when we're trying to process something new or difficult. We can't always see how other people might feel about what we're experiencing. So, if someone has a hard time understanding why you're upset, try to find out what their perspective is. Maybe they have experienced similar situations before and know how to respond. Or maybe they just don't understand why you're so angry. Try to empathize with them and let them know that you understand their perspective.\nIf you still feel frustrated after talking to them, then ask yourself whether there's anything else you could've done differently. Did you make eye contact? Were you listening carefully? Did you take notes? If you were able to provide an explanation, did they seem receptive to it?\nIt's okay to disagree with someone's opinion, but remember that disagreement doesn't mean disrespect. Be mindful of how you express yourself and consider the impact of your words on others. Remember that everyone has a right to their own opinion and respect for their beliefs. And even though you may not agree with everything they say, it's important to listen to their perspective and show empathy towards their experiences. By doing so, you'll likely build stronger relationships with those around you and create a more inclusive environment.\n"}
