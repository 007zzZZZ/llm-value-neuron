I want to walk through the streets where the characters walked, smell the air, and hear sounds from the city around me. I want to taste food that was eaten at the same table as the main character. I want to touch objects that were used by the main character. I want to meet people who knew the main character and talk to them about their lives. I want to learn about the culture of the country where the main character lived. I want to understand why he chose to live in that particular town. I want to see the sights that inspired him to write his book. I want to see the things that made him happy. I want to feel the feelings that he felt while writing his book. I want to feel the sense of accomplishment that comes from finishing a project. I want to feel the sense of satisfaction that comes from creating something beautiful. I want to feel the sense of wonderment that comes from discovering something new. I want to feel the sense of awe that comes from understanding the universe.
