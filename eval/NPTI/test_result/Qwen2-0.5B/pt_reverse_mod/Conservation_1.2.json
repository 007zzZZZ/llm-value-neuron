They had a great time and took many photos. The teacher wanted to know how many pictures they took together. She told them that she counted 125 photos. But when they looked at their own photos, they found out that only 60% of their photos were taken together. How many photos did they take together? To find out how many photos they took together, we can set up a proportion:\n\n\\[\\frac{125}{x} = \\frac{60}{100}\\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) represents the number of photos they took together.\n\nCross multiplying gives us:\n\n\\[125 \\cdot 100 = 60 \\cdot x \\]\n\\[12500 = 60x \\]\n\\[x = \\frac{12500}{60} \\approx 208.33\\]\n\nSince the number of photos must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 208.\n\nSo, they took 208 photos together.\n\nThe original problem was asking for the number of photos they took together, so we need to add 208 to the total number of photos they took together (125).\n\nTherefore, they took 208 + 125 = 333 photos altogether.\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem correct because the original problem asked for the number of photos they took together, not the number of individual photos they took individually. Let's reevaluate the problem.\n\nIf they took 125 photos together, then they should have taken 125 / 2 = 62.5 photos each. However, since they can't take half a photo, they must have taken 62 photos each.\n\nNow let's reevaluate the problem again.\n\nThey took 125 photos together, but they also took 62 photos each. So, they took 125 + 62 = 187 photos altogether.\n\nThis still seems incorrect because the original problem asked for the number of photos they took together, not the number of individual photos they took individually.

The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $20. If the company produces and sells 500 units of both products, how many units of each should they produce to maximize their profits? Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. Then, the total profit from selling all the units of product A is 10x and the total profit from selling all the units of product B is 20y. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nmaximize (10x + 20y)\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx + y ≤ 500\n\nx ≥ 0\n\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we need to find the partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to x and y:\n\n∂(10x + 20y)/∂x = 10\n\n∂(10x + 20y)/∂y = 20\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of the objective function using the first derivative test:\n\nCritical point occurs when the second derivative is equal to zero:\n\n∂²(10x + 20y)/∂x² = 0\n\n∂²(10x + 20y)/∂y² = 0\n\nSince the second derivative is always positive, there will be an absolute maximum or minimum value at the critical point.
