The student may feel overwhelmed and lose sight of the bigger picture. Instead of trying to complete everything at once, the student could delegate some of the work to another team member who is also responsible for the project. This allows the student to focus on the most challenging aspects of the project and gives them more time to complete the rest of the work themselves. By delegating some of the work, the student can still maintain their own productivity and quality standards, while still allowing the team member to contribute their expertise and skills. In this way, the student can continue to work towards their goal of finishing the project on time without feeling overwhelmed or burnt out."}
