For example, if the survey is intended for customers who have specific concerns about the product, then it may be appropriate to focus on addressing these concerns.\n\n2. The nature of the product or service: The survey should be focused on the product or service being reviewed, rather than its features or benefits.

The context of the survey: The survey should be conducted in a neutral and objective manner, without any bias or personal opinions. This will help ensure that the survey results are fair and unbiased.\n\n4.
