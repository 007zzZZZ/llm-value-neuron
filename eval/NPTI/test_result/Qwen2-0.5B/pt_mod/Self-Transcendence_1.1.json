You could also ask the other members to share their own experiences or stories related to the book.\n2.

This can help build trust and create a sense of community among the group.\n3. Encourage open communication: It's easy to feel isolated when we're stuck in writer's block. Encouraging open communication about what's going on and how everyone else is feeling can help us all stay motivated and focused.\n4.
