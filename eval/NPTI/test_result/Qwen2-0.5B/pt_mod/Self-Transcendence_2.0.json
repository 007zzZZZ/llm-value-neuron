We initialize a variable `max_val` with the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). Then, we iterate through the rest of the array using a loop. For each number in the array, we compare it to the current `max_val`. If the number is greater than `max_val`, we update `max_val` to be the new value. Finally, we return `max_val`.\n\nThe main part of the code simply calls `find_max` with an example array `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]` and prints the result, which should be `18`."}
