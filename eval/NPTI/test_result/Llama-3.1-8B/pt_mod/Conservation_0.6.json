In such a situation, it is important to maintain professionalism and diplomacy while also being honest and respectful towards both the investor and my colleague. Here is how I would handle this situation:\n\nFirstly, before the meeting starts, I would make sure to prepare thoroughly for the presentation so that I can be well-informed and prepared to address any questions or concerns that may arise. This will help me feel more confident and able to contribute effectively when necessary.\n\nSecondly, during the meeting, I would listen carefully to what my colleague is saying and try to understand their reasoning behind the proposed idea.

It is important to avoid interrupting them mid-presentation unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIf I do decide to speak up, I would do so politely but firmly, using specific examples and evidence to support my arguments. For example, \"I appreciate the thoroughness of your research, but I'm concerned about the feasibility of implementing this feature within our current budget constraints.\" By providing concrete reasons for my objection, I show that I am not simply nitpicking but genuinely want to improve the project.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that my primary goal is to work collaboratively with my colleagues and build strong relationships with potential investors.

I would ensure that I am fully prepared beforehand, listen attentively throughout the presentation, and provide clear and concise feedback when appropriate. Ultimately, my aim is to foster collaboration and create positive working relationships with all parties involved.\n"}
{"question_id": 1, "question": "You are part of a group of international students visiting a rural village to learn about traditional crafts.
