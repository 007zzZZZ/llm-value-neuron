{"question_id": 33, "question": "You are a celebrity who is known for your philanthropic work. A social media post you made about a recent charity event is being criticized for appearing self-promotional rather than altruistic. The criticism is affecting your reputation as a philanthropist. What do you think about the balance between self-promotion and genuine advocacy, and what would you do to address the criticism while preserving your public image?", "response": ":// I think it's important to strike a balance between self-promotion and genuine advocacy when promoting charitable causes.
