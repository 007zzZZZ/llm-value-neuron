It's important to have a clear understanding of the financial implications before making any decisions.\n3. Risk Assessment: Risk assessment involves identifying potential risks associated with the new technology, such as technical challenges, regulatory hurdles, or legal issues. We need to carefully analyze these risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. Risk management is critical to ensuring the success of the project.\n4.
